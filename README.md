# Innovative Idea
Nugget is a virtual pet website in which individual users can login, create and customize their own pet, and interact with others. Users of Nugget have the ability to create their own ‘Nugget’ and customize them to their hearts content. They can access the Store and purchase items to customize their Nugget, and interact with other users through the Chat feature. The site largely functions as an interactive social network of these Nuggets.
Nugget takes inspiration from 2000s based pet websites such as Neopets, Webkinz or Club Penguin in that users login and interact with each other. Where our application differs is that it focuses less on the ‘game’ part of these sites and focuses on the customization/social aspect. Granted, our site still features a ‘battle arena’ in which users compete and wager their Coins.
